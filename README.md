# Model Building

Welcome to our model building project, a project focused on predicting ratings of recipes. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the ratings of recipes based on various features such as ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty level. This is a regression problem, as the predicted variable (ratings) is a continuous numerical variable.

Our response variable is the recipe rating, which ranges from 1 to 5. We chose this variable because it is a crucial factor for determining the success and popularity of a recipe. Our model will assist users in finding recipes that are likely to be highly rated, leading to a more satisfying cooking experience.

The dataset used for this analysis is collected from <a href="food.com">food.com</a>. and contains information on a variety of recipes, including their ingredients, cooking times, and user ratings. By exploring this data, we hope to gain insights into the factors that contribute to a recipeâ€™s success and popularity.

To evaluate our model's performance, we will use the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. This metric measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual ratings. We chose RMSE because it provides a more comprehensive measure of our model's accuracy compared to other metrics such as mean absolute error.

We hope that this project will help food enthusiasts and cooking enthusiasts discover new and highly-rated recipes with ease.
